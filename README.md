# Transfer-Portal-PDF
Project for BYU Basketball that takes all the players currently in the transfer portal and outputs a brief report on each player. I'm not able to include the csv files or the link to the streamlit app because some of the data I used for this project is from a paid service; however, I have included my code that creates the reports. 

### Files:

Transfer Reports.Rmd is the initial code I wrote over a year ago to generate the reports
Transfer.pdf is an example of the output from the R markdown code
main.py is the code I used to create the streamlit app
project.ipynb is the updated verson of the 'Transfer Reports.Rmd' code
tppdf.pdf is an example of what the updated output/streamlit dashboard looks like
